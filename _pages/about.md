I am a third-year Ph.D. student at [KAIST School of Computing](https://cs.kaist.ac.kr/), advised by [Alice Oh](https://aliceoh9.github.io/). My research interests are in developing graph neural networks for various domains: social networks, codes, or chemicals. In particular, I focus on (1) leveraging the inherent information in the graph structure (e.g., edges, subgraphs, or temporal snapshots) and (2) analyzing the model performance by characteristics of graph datasets (e.g., homophily, average degree, or density).
