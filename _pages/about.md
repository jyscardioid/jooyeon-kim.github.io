I am a postdoctoral researcher at [RIKEN Center for Advanced Intelligence Project (AIP)](https://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/aip/), in [Approximate Bayesian Inference (ABI) team](https://team-approx-bayes.github.io/). I strive to derive human-like machine intelligence from interactive and autonomous learning experiences. I focus on exploiting/uncovering the merits of Bayesian learning that provides principled way of allowing machine intelligence to adapt and generalize to unseen data/environments in conjunction with the deep learning models and frameworks.
